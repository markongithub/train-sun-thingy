    p It tells you which side of your train (or bus) will get more sunlight.
    h2 Choose your agency.
    select(id="agencyKey")
      option
      each agencyKey in agencyKeys
        option #{agencyKey}
    h2 Then choose your date.
    select(id="date")
      option
    h2 Then choose your source stop.
    select(id="sourceStop")
      option
    h2 Then choose your trip.
    select(id="trip")
      option
    h2 Then choose your destination.

      p Red segments on the map are travel with the sun on the vehicle's right. Blue segments have the sun on the left. Black segments are when the sun is below the horizon.
      p You can render the map for this same schedule on another date (regardless of whether it actually runs on that date):

    h2 Hypothetically asked questions:
    ul
      li
        p Q. Why?
        p A. Sometimes when we ride trains the sun gets in our faces and we don't like it. Also we wanted to learn about Node.js.
      li
        p Q. How?
        p A. <a href="https://github.com/markongithub/train-sun-thingy">Source code is in Github.</a> We get transit data (schedules and route maps) directly from individual transit agencies as <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/">GTFS</a>. We convert those local timestamps to UTC with <a href="https://momentjs.com/">Moment</a>. Then we get the position of the sun from <a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc">Suncalc</a>.
      li
        p Q. So you handle timezones and DST correctly?
        p A. Mostly, we think. If you pick a trip near sunrise or sunset, you may see its sun behavior change when your country goes through its DST shift. That's expected.
        p Two cases we don't handle are trips that take place DURING the DST shift (but it should be dark then, right?) or trips spanning multiple time zones (which is why we have no Amtrak or Eurostar for the time being).
      li
        p Q. What about tunnels?
        p A. We don't know anything about tunnels, tall buildings, mountains, or any other object that gets between the sun and a vehicle. GTFS includes latitude and longitude but not altitude. It would be possible, but very difficult, to pull all the relevant terrain data out of whatever source Google Earth uses.
      li
        p Q. Why no UK trains? UK trains are cool.
        p A. They are, but their data is exported as something called TransXChange instead of GTFS. There are multiple projects <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=transxchange+to+gtfs&type=">attempting this conversion</a> but we have not yet used any of them successfully. We are probably going to write our own. If you are one of our good friends or relatives in the UK, we have intentionally not emailed you this site yet.
        p Technically, we do have the trains from Belfast down to the Irish border.
      li
        p Q. What about this other railway I like?
        ul
          li RATP: They have no shapefiles.
          li South Shore Line: they have no GTFS.
          li VRE: We will add them as soon as they fix their shape files to be bidirectional. Right now <i>shape_pt_sequence</i> only increases for trains heading into DC, which violates the GTFS spec. Or maybe we'll add a bunch of custom code to try reversing them in memory, which is probably what other developers have done.
      li
        p Q. I picked an agency and it has no service dates.
        p A. That's because we failed to update the GTFS feed for that agency. Sorry.
      li
        p Q. MongoDB? Really?
        p A. It's required in order to use <a href="https://github.com/BlinkTagInc/node-gtfs">node-gtfs</a>. And Docker makes it gloriously easy to deploy.
